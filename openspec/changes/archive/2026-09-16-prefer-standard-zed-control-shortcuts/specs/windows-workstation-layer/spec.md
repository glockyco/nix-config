## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Windows-first Zed control shortcuts

The rendered Windows configuration SHALL keep Zed Vim mode enabled and SHALL declare a user keymap for full editors. In every Vim mode, standard Windows and VS Code `Ctrl` shortcuts SHALL take precedence over Vim's `Ctrl` commands. The standard shortcuts SHALL include copy, cut, paste, select all, undo, redo, save, find, replace, quick open, command palette, new file, open file, recent projects, symbol search, go to line, select next occurrence, dock toggles, and close editor. `Ctrl+K` SHALL remain available as the base keymap's chord prefix. Vim-only single-key `Ctrl` commands that have no selected Windows action SHALL do nothing in a full editor.

The override SHALL NOT change unmodified Vim keys, `Escape`, terminal input, menus, panels, or other non-editor surfaces. The Windows apply operation SHALL converge the declared keymap as complete configuration rather than preserve undeclared keymap entries.

#### Scenario: Copy from normal mode

- **WHEN** a full Zed editor is in Vim normal mode and the operator presses `Ctrl+C`
- **THEN** Zed invokes its editor copy action
- **AND** Zed does not invoke a Vim mode or operator action

#### Scenario: Use standard shortcuts across Vim modes

- **WHEN** a full Zed editor is in normal, visual, insert, replace, operator, or waiting mode
- **THEN** each declared standard `Ctrl` shortcut invokes the same Zed action in every mode
- **AND** `Escape` remains the way to cancel an operator or return to normal mode

#### Scenario: Use Vim without its control layer

- **WHEN** the operator uses an unmodified Vim motion, operator, text object, register, or command in a full editor
- **THEN** Zed retains its Vim behavior
- **AND** a Vim-only single-key `Ctrl` command selected for removal does not run

#### Scenario: Use a base keymap chord

- **WHEN** the operator starts a declared `Ctrl+K` chord in a full editor
- **THEN** Zed waits for and runs the base keymap chord
- **AND** it does not start Vim's digraph input

#### Scenario: Use a terminal or non-editor surface

- **WHEN** focus is in Zed's terminal, menu, panel, or another non-editor surface
- **THEN** the surface retains its existing context-specific `Ctrl` behavior

#### Scenario: Converge a changed keymap

- **WHEN** the Windows Zed keymap contains an undeclared binding or differs from the rendered declaration
- **THEN** the apply operation restores the complete declared keymap
- **AND** the next test operation reports the resource in the desired state
